# Joshua Peters â€“ Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my personal portfolio site!  
This site introduces who I am as a **data analyst** and highlights my experience, skills, and professional background. While my focus is on analytics and business insight, this site also reflects my technical foundation in full stack development.

The portfolio is fully custom-built using modern web technologies and serves as a central hub for my resume, experience, and contact information.
